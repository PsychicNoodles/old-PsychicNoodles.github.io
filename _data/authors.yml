    Hello, I'm Mattori. I also go by PsychicNoodles.

    I am a web engineer at [Careertrek (キャリトレ)](https://www.careertrek.com/).
    Careertrek is built using (and I work professionally in) Spring Boot in
    Java for the backend and TypeScript + React for the frontend.
    I also dabble in Rust, break my desktop environment trying to use xmonad,
    and tinker with hobby projects.

    I am also a student of the Japanese language, having studied since 2015,
    and have followed my language interests to Japan. I am currently studying
    for the JLPT N2 with plans for the N1 as well as trying my best to go out
    into the world and practice spoken Japanese.
