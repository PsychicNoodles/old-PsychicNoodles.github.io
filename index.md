Hello, I'm Mattori. I also go by [PsychicNoodles](http://github.com/PsychicNoodles).

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at [Grinnell College](http://www.grinnell.edu/),
where I major in Computer Science and (intend to) concentrate/minor in East
Asian Studies. In the Fall semester of my third year I studied abroad through
[IES](https://www.iesabroad.org/) at [Nanzan University](http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/)
in Nagoya, Japan.

In terms of CS, I am in [AppDev](http://appdev.grinnell.edu/) as the Android section lead.
My primary CS interests are software development, intersections between CS and language,
and systems programming.

In terms of East Asian Studies, I am formally studying Japanese in preparation for the
JLPT N2 test, learned Korean from student teachers for a semester, and studied Chinese
formally throughout high school and for a semester at Grinnell.

If you would like to contact me directly, please email me at
<mattori.birnbaum@gmail.com>.
