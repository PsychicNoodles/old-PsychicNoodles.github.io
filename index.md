Hello, I'm Mattori. I also go by [PsychicNoodles](http://github.com/PsychicNoodles).

Welcome to my website. I mainly post about my accomplishments and thoughts about
programming or languages, and sometimes I share projects I've worked on. Perhaps
one day there will be even more fun stuff.

I am a second year undergraduate student at [Grinnell College](http://www.grinnell.edu/),
where I (intend to) major in Computer Science and (intend to ) minor in East
Asian Studies.

In terms of CS, I am in [AppDev](http://appdev.grinnell.edu/) as a senior
Android developer and Android Education lead in training. I also tutor CS
students in the evenings. My primary CS interests are software development,
intersections between CS and language, and other topics as they seem cool to me.

In terms of East Asian Studies, I am formally studying Japanese at a second-year
level, learned Korean from student teachers for a semester, and studied Chinese
formally throughout high school and for a semester at Grinnell.

If you would like to contact me directly, please email me at
<mattori.birnbaum@gmail.com>.
